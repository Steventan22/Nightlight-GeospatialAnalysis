# Nightlight-GeospatialAnalysis

## Overview
The imposition of community restrictions, also known as lockdowns, has been widely adopted by numerous countries to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. This research, conducted by one dedicated faculty member and three enthusiastic students, delves into the impact of these restrictions using Night Time Light (NTL) Data obtained from satellite imagery captured during nighttime. A total of 381 public locations in Jakarta were selected as sample coordinates, and the corresponding data was extracted using the VIIRS Stray Light Corrected Nighttime Day/Night Band Composites Version 1 dataset from Q1 2019 to Q2 2022. The satellite images were then converted into numerical data and correlated with the timeline of community restrictions in Indonesia, along with mobility data specific to the Jakarta region.

## Research Objectives
- Data Collection: Utilize Night Time Light (NTL) Data derived from satellite imagery to analyze the impact of Covid-19 restrictions on nighttime illumination.
- Coordinate Sampling: Select 381 public locations in Jakarta to serve as sample coordinates for detailed analysis.
- Data Extraction: Extract data from the VIIRS Stray Light Corrected Nighttime Day/Night Band Composites Version 1 dataset spanning Q1 2019 to Q2 2022.
- Numerical Conversion: Convert satellite images into numerical data for correlation analysis.
- Correlation Analysis: Correlate the NTL data with the timeline of community restrictions in Indonesia and mobility data for the Jakarta region.
- Intensity Analysis: Analyze the changes in light intensity during different phases of Covid-19 restrictions.

## Research Findings
The research findings reveal a notable decrease in light intensity during periods of community restrictions, ranging from 1% to 16% across various sectors. This decrease in intensity does not exhibit a strong correlation with mobility data for several sectors, indicating a change in activity of up to 60%.

## Disclaimer
The research findings are based on the data available at the time of the study and may be subject to changes. Further analysis and validation may be required for comprehensive insights.
